I lead the Machine Learning effort at **GlobalEnglish**, an Education company building software for English learning and assessment based in San Mateo, CA. 

My work focuses mainly on **Natural Language Processing** and in particular Natural Language Generation to create English learning material automatically, such as Reading Comprehension questions. Using algorithms to generate English exercises automatically provides the learners with content that is relevant to them (purposeful), adapted to their level and their learning style. Ultimately, the goal is to scale the content creation in order to personalize - read optimize - the way people learn English.

I am also very interested in **Speech Processing** applications and in this respect I am developing acoustic models to score English pronunciation automatically, investigating D-vector extraction for Speaker Identification, and researching pre-training and multi-task learning methods for Speech Recognition.
 
Before joining GlobalEnglish, I graduated from **ESSEC Business School** (Paris) with a Baschelor and a Master in Economics and Management, and from **Ecole Polytechnique** (Paris) with a Master in Data Science.

When I am not training my neural networks on a GPU, I usually go surfing in Santa Cruz or cook Japanese cuisine.

Feel free to read my blog posts (still work in progress though) or reach out to me!
