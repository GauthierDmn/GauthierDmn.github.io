I am a Machine Learning Engineer working at **Feedly**, a startup based in Redwood City (CA) whose mission is to empower people to learn more and feed their passions through content.

My work focuses on **Natural Language Processing**, and consists in building and scaling **Information Extraction** algorithms which are used to power our AI research assistant Leo.

I am also a deep advocate of ‘AI for good’ projects, and was previously leading the Machine Learning effort at **GlobalEnglish**, a language learning company, where I used NLP and Speech Processing to personalize the way people learn English.

The idea was to develop Natural Language Generation algorithms to create English learning material automatically, providing the learners with content that is relevant to them (purposeful) and adapted to their level and learning style. I also grew a great interest for **Speech Processing** applications at that time, and turned research experiments on automatic English pronunciation scoring into production ready software.

I graduated from **ESSEC Business School** (Paris) with a Master in Economics and Management, and from **Ecole Polytechnique** (Paris) with a Master in Data Science.

When I am not training my neural networks on a GPU, I usually go surfing in Santa Cruz, or cook Japanese cuisine.

Feel free to read my blog posts (still work in progress though) or reach out to me!
